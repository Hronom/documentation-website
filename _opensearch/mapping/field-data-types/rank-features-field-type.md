# Rank features field type
Field type `rank_features` index numeric feature map that can be used to boost documents, by using [rank_feature]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/rank-feature/) query.

This data type is better suited when the list of features is sparse and there no reason to add for each feature field in the mappings.

`positive_score_impact` - declare how features correlates with score during [rank_feature]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/rank-feature/) query.
For instance, if set flag `positive_score_impact` to `false` it will correlate negatively with score, if set `true` - positive. Default is `true`.

`rank_features` fields must be a hash with string keys and strictly positive numeric values.
{: .tip }

`rank_features` fields not supports multi-valued fields and negative values. During indexation - they will be rejected.
{: .note }

`rank_features` fields do not support querying, sorting or aggregating. They only used within [rank_feature]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/opensearch/query-dsl/rank-feature/) queries.
{: .note }

`rank_features` fields only preserve 9 significant bits for the precision, which translates to a relative error of about 0.4%. In practice this limitation means that values are stored with a relative precision of `2^âˆ’8 = 0.00390625`, [source](https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_9_0/core/org/apache/lucene/document/FeatureField.html).
